        <h1>Websites</h1>
        <p>
          As a skilled web developer and designer, I have a passion for creating
          visually appealing and user-friendly websites that meet the needs of
          businesses and organizations. With a solid foundation in web design
          principles and programming languages, I am able to develop websites
          that not only look great but are also functional and responsive. My
          experience includes designing and developing custom websites, as well
          as managing and maintaining existing ones.
        </p>
        <p id="indented">
          I stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices in the
          field. In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for
          design and a deep understanding of user experience (UX) principles.
          This allows me to create websites that not only look great, but also
          provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.

          I also have experience studying video game development at the
          South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Science. During my time
          there, I was able to develop a wide range of skills necessary for
          video game development, including programming, game design,
          storytelling, graphic design, sound design, project management,
          marketing, and more. I gained a deep understanding of the video game
          industry and learned how to create engaging and immersive gaming
          experiences. Through my studies, I was able to work on several game
          development projects, where I was able to apply my skills in a
          practical setting. This allowed me to gain hands-on experience and
          learn how to work collaboratively with others to achieve a common
          goal. I'm excited to continue developing my skills in video game
          development and creating innovative gaming experiences that captivate
          and entertain audiences.

          I have a strong background in game development, having worked on
          several projects during my studies at the university. In particular, I
          have experience in programming, game design, storytelling, graphic
          design, sound design, project management, and marketing. One of my
          personal projects was the development of an RPG game, in which I
          created a main panel using canvas for the game's graphical user
          interface (GUI). I implemented various game mechanics such as
          character movement using a navmesh, character abilities, and managing
          character life and death. I also worked on character animations,
          exporting and importing characters into the game, and creating unique
          abilities for each character. This project allowed me to apply my
          skills and knowledge in game development to create a captivating and
          immersive game.

          In addition to my experience in graphic design and game development, I
          have also worked with databases, specifically MySQL. I am
          knowledgeable in retrieving data from multiple tables, inserting,
          updating, and deleting data, summarizing data, and writing complex
          queries. Additionally, I am familiar with essential MySQL functions
          and techniques. To further expand my knowledge in the field of
          artificial intelligence, I have been learning Python. I have completed
          several small projects, including automation with Python, machine
          learning with Python, and building a website with Django. I am excited
          to continue learning new programs and techniques to broaden my skills
          and stay current with industry trends.
